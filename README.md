# Simple GitHub Browser
Used in the archive and mirror.

Provides a simple interface for browsing and downloading files in a github repo.
## Installing in your own github pages
- Create a folder /docs in your github repo. (Optional, but recommended.)
- Go to Settings > Pages and select "/docs" instead of "/ (Root)" and click Save.
- Paste this file to /docs/index.html
- Replace [Name Here] with your repo name
- Replace all [repo] with your repo (e.g. nogeese-org/simple-github-browser)
- Set the MIRROR_URL value (What's the website the files are hosted on? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[repo]/main/ is recommended)
- Done!
